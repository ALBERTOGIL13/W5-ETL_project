# Project: ETL 

## Introduction

The main objective of this project is to familiarize ourselves with the concept of ETL (Extract, Transform and Load) and to apply some of the data extraction techniques we have learned. 

The ultimate goal is to extract data from at least three different data sources and use two different extraction methods. Once the data has been extracted and modified, load it into a relational or non-relational database. 

# Steps

-First, choose the subject from which you want to extract the data and verify that there are at least 3 different sources from which you can extract the data  

-Then, you have to think about which method you can use to get the data you want.  

-Once you have extracted the data, you have to verify that the data are clean and if they are not clean, proceed to clean them until you have data that can be useful to you 

-When we have all the data, we have to think about the relationships between them and modify the tables so that they provide as much information as possible in a clear way.    

Finally, you have to load the database in a different place depending on whether it is relational or not or the plans you have for the future with that database.  

# Final conclusions 

It is a perfect project to know what an ETL is and to be able to put into practice everything you have learned in relation to data mining and also to do research on topics that interest you.
